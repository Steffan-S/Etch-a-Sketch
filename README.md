# Assignment: Build Etch-a-Sketch

### Objective:
In this project, youâ€™ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex your DOM manipulation skills. Youâ€™re going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

### Task:
Create a dynamic webpage featuring a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript and apply a hover effect.
   
- Grid Creation:
  Generate the grid squares dynamically using JavaScript.
  Enclose the grid squares within a container div placed directly in your HTML.
  Utilize flexbox to display the divs in a grid layout.

- Hover Effect:
  Implement a hover effect causing the grid divs to change color.
  Set up event listeners for mouse entering and leaving divs.

- User-Defined Grid Size:
  Add a button at the top for user interaction.
  Upon clicking, prompt the user for the number of squares per side for the new grid.
  Remove the existing grid and generate a new grid within the same total space.
  Set a maximum limit of 100 squares to prevent potential performance issues.
